I should've asked for help and stay late after class. There's a problem with that though, I never know when to ask.
I understood the bare minimum of how the MVC layout goes but only after we started the Mars project.
The fault is my own for not getting any further on this.
Hopefully I can learn faster and think more like a programmer. (The sooner the better right?)
I think that is my MAIN problem though. I am NOT thinking like a programmer.
Logic is easy to understand when someone tells you A + B = C
However, the best way I can describe my situation is this: I can read code as if it were (Insert foreign language here), I have learned to read it by the repition and context thus far learned. My problem is taking that language and making a sentence out of it. No idea what the grammar should look like, what the context is. Adjectives, pronouns. I'm just drawing a blank when it comes to putting anything on the screen. To put this another way... I like to watch anime. Lots of people do. Most like to enjoy it with the subs, aka origanal language spoken with ENG subtitles. I am one of those people. I can see the context of the code on the screen. I can remember familiar terms and recognize patterns in the code/language. Saying some (Insert foreign language here) on my own, NO DICE. I couldn't speak a proper sentence even if I wanted to.
One of the instructors has said that I am putting roadblocks in my own way. To prevent myself from succeeding.
Sad thing is, I can't see the roadblocks. Not in the sense that I don't see the problem,  no. I don't know how to get around it.
I am honestly thinking right now that this is not going to work out for me. 2 strikes already and we aren't even halfway there...
I do want this to work out though, I want to have this kind of knowledge under my belt. To keep my life moving forward and not have to move backwards again.
It would be discouraging, they said...
It would be tough, they said...
I don't doubt them for a second.

Please help me though. I don't even...
